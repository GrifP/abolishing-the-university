## Abolitionist Approaches

This module looks at abolitionist approaches more generally, stepping away from the application to the university. In a Jacobin article, Dan Berger, Mariame Kaba, and David Stein take the case of prison abolitionists, tracing their organizing back through a history of state violence and making the claim that abolition is rooted in organizing for concrete reforms, not naive dreams. Mariame Kaba expands on these in an audio interview.
