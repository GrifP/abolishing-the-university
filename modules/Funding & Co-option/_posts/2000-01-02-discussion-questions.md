## Discussion Questions
*   In the introduction of *The Revolution Will Not Be Funded*,the authors outline the limitations of biases of what they call the Non-Profit Industrial Complex. How would you augment their list when thinking exclusively about institutes higher education?
*   What are areas of inquiry that you think could benefit society but aren’t likely to get support and funding in the current system?
*   The INCITE! Collective calls on us to “think beyond state-proctored models like the non-profit system for organizing political projects for social change”. What does learning and education look like beyond a state-proctored model?
