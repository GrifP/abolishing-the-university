## Funding and Liberal Co-option of Radical Spaces

This module examines how funding and not-for-profit organizational structures can work to contain and co-opt radical social movements. The main readings introduce the idea of the “non-profit industrial complex” and the mechanisms by which radical spaces have been historically suppressed.
