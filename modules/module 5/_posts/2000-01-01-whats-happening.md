## What’s happening in your area?

In the final module, it’s time to apply what you’ve learned to future practice. 

Activities:


*   Look up your area’s schools in UnKoch My Campus [funding database](https://polluterwatch.org/charles-koch-university-funding-database). 
*   Look at Strike University! [Abolitionist Resources](https://strikeuniversity.org/Abolitionist-Resources) for getting police off your campus.
