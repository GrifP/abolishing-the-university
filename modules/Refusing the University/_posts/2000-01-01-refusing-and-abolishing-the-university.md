## Refusing The University

The first module of this course introduces the pairing of university and abolition studies, charting a path for understanding the possibilities of education and study that live beyond our current institutional conceptions of colleges and universities. The main readings for this first module are two chapters from Stefano Harney and Fred Moten's 2013 _The Undercommons: Fugitive Study and Black Planning_, followed by a 2016 article by Robin D.G. Kelley reflecting on academia’s response to the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.



*   Harney and Moten. [The Undercommons: Fugitive Study and Black Planning](https://www.minorcompositions.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/undercommons-web.pdf) (Chapter 2, “The University and the Undercommons,” and Chapter 4, “Debt and Study”)
*   Robin Kelley. [Black Study, Black Struggle](http://bostonreview.net/forum/robin-d-g-kelley-black-study-black-struggle) 

Supplemental to this are two optional readings that elaborate on these themes. *Abolition University Studies: An Invitation* outlines the scope of this growing field of work, and *Refusing the University* centers the university as institutional appendage of the settler colonial state.
