## Discussion Questions
<br>
*Each module contains a handful of discussion questions to the learning circle. You should by no means feel bound to them.*

*   Reflect on Harney and Moten's invitation to reinterpret abolitionism as "not so much the abolition of prisons but the abolition of a society that could have prisons, that could have slavery, that could have the wage, and therefore not abolition as the elimination of anything but abolition as the founding of a new society." 
*   In Chapter 2, Harney and Moten write about the professionalization of universities and academics as at odds with radical study. What do you see as examples of an alternative approach? How does this equate to the concept of ‘refuge’ introduced in Chapter 4?
*   Respond to Robin Kelley’s claim that universities will never be engines of social transformation.
