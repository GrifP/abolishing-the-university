# Abolishing the University

Can the university serve as the basis for social transformation?

Should we work to abolish the university as it currently exists?

What can you organize locally for activist study?

This five-part course presents a series of freely accessible works that examine universities from an abolitionist perspective, followed by a number of discussion and reflection questions. Each module is designed to be engaged first alone (approx. 2-3 hours/week), and then in a weekly reading group following the learning circle format. You are, of course, free to simply work through everything alone. For more about setting up a learning circle, visit [p2pu.org](https://p2pu.org).
