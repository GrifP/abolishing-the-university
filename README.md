# Abolishing the University

Should we work to abolish the university as it currently exists?

How can we create spaces for collective study?

This five-part course presents a series of freely accessible works that examine universities from an abolitionist perspective, followed by a number of discussion and reflection questions. Each module is designed to be engaged first alone (approx. 2-3 hours/week), and then in a weekly reading group following the learning circle format.
